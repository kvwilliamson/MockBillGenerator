Filename: 1-MB-CCSI-EMLV5-ER-v1
Scenario Selected: ER E/M Level Inflation
Description: ER visit billed at Level 5 without supporting complexity
Narrative (Read-Only): Patient presents to the ER with mild chest discomfort. Vitals stable, ECG performed.
Truth Validity report:
Detectable Error: ⚠️ Detectable
        Analysis: The bill includes CPT code 99285 (Emergency Department Visit for the Evaluation and Management of a 
        patient, which requires a physician or other qualified health care professional of the emergency department, a 
        comprehensive history, a comprehensive examination, and moderate complexity medical decision making) billed twice 
        for both facility and professional charges. However, the clinical record indicates a patient presenting with mild 
        chest discomfort, stable vitals, and a benign ECG, managed with basic interventions and discharge. This clinical 
        picture does not support the complexity required for a Level 5 E/M service (99285). A lower-level E/M code (e.g., 
        99283 or 99284) would be more appropriate for this presentation.
        Investigation Needs: Detailed documentation of the history of present illness, review of systems, physical 
        examination findings, and medical decision making to justify the selected E/M level. Comparison of the billed 
        E/M code with the documented services and complexity is crucial.

Filename: 2-MB-CCSI-TRAUMA-ER-v1
Scenario Selected: Trauma Activation Abuse
Description: Trauma activation fee billed without trauma criteria
Narrative (Read-Only): 
Minor fall at home; patient brought to trauma center. No major injuries.
Truth Validity report:
Detectable Error: ✅ Likely Hidden
        Analysis: The bill includes a trauma activation fee (represented by CPT 
code 99284-TC for facility charges) which is not supported by the clinical docum
entation. The patient's presentation, vital signs, examination findings, and dia
gnosis indicate a minor fall at home with no significant injuries, not a trauma 
activation event.
        Investigation Needs: Trauma activation criteria protocols and guidelines
 for the facility.
